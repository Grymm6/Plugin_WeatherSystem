<!-- 
NOTE: In order for fading to work properly, every node that can be faded must be present. Tod vars, clouds, sounds, entities, particles are faded before situation ends,
rain and snow are faded over to the new situation's values

position attribute can also be filled with the name of an existing entity in the level
beware: if you want an entity's position the level must be loaded beforehand, meaning you need to reload the definitions after level load
also, the pos is not adjusted if the entity moves
